This section details how users can discover, access, and leverage TGDeX's core capabilitiesâ€”**Data Banks**, **AI Models**, **Potential Applications**, and the **Sandbox IDE**. It explains the search, sort, and filter tools that simplify finding the right data banks, AI models, or potential applications, and outlines the steps for uploading new assets or downloading existing ones. Finally, it also shows how to import and work with these assets inside the Sandbox IDE, enabling users to prototype, test, and deploy AI-driven solutions in a unified environment.
