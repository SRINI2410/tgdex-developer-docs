To publish Data Banks, AI Models, or Potential Applications on TGDeX, users must join an organization. By affiliating with an approved organization—such as a government department, startup, research institute, or private enterprise—users gain the **Publisher** role and the permissions required to upload and manage assets under that organization’s governance. This ensures accountability for all published content

Following are the steps to join an already registered organization on the platform.

**Step 1:** Click on the **Join an Organisation** button on your dashboard.
