If a user’s organization isn’t yet registered on TGDeX, the user can submit a request to add it by providing organization details and supporting documents. Only a person authorized by that organization may complete this step, since they will assume the sole Organization Manager role. As Organization Manager, the user will have responsibility for adding and managing members, assigning publisher roles, and overseeing all assets published under the organization’s name. Once the organization is approved and the user designated as its manager, no additional Organization Manager accounts can be created for that organization.

**Step 1:** Click on “Join an Organisation” button on your dashboard.

  Provide details like entity type, sector, organisation name, website, and address.

- **Upload Organisation Documents:**  
  Upload the following required documents:
    - Firm Incorporation Certificate
    - PAN Card of the organisation
    - Authorization document (stating that the user is authorized by their organisation to become an Organisation Manager on TGDeX and manage users and assets on its behalf)
    - Any other supporting document (optional)

After the request is reviewed and approved, the user will be assigned the Organisation Manager role and can begin managing users and assets under the new organisation.
