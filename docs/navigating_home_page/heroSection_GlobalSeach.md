## Hero section and Global search

The Hero section welcomes users with the TGDeX tagline—“Where AI Meets Innovation” and “Discover, Experiment, Create!”—set against a clean background to draw attention to the platform’s core promise. Centrally positioned is the global search bar, where users can enter keywords to discover Data Banks, AI Models, and Potential Applications. As users type, the search suggests matching items grouped by category, and a single click on **Go** delivers a unified results page. This combination of a bold, engaging header and an intelligent, all-in-one search tool ensures users can immediately find and act on the resources they need.
